    <p>Poetry often uses figurative language, which has different meanings from what is literally said. 
        Poetry can be structured in forms like haikus, sonnets, and limericks. 
        Poetry can be used to convey love, anger, hate, magic, and more. 
        Poetry can be a way to build community by sharing poetry with others.</p>
